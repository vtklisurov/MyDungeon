Install Python

Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
	Install necessary packages by running these commands in the Terminal/Command Prompt (I think that's all of them):
		npm i async
		npm i bcrypt@5.0.0
		npm i body-parser
		npm i connect-redis
		npm i express 
		npm i express-session 
		npm i formidable //not sure if necessary
		npm i jquery //not sure if necessary
		npm i mustache //not sure if necessary
		npm i md5
		npm i node-postgres@latest
		npm i node-schedule
		npm i nodemailer
		npm i paypal-rest-sdk
		npm i pg@latest
		npm i pg-promise
		npm i redis
		npm i redis-server
	
Install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
	In PgAdmin4 click Tools->Restore and select the store_db file (hope this works)
	
Open connector.js and edit the connection string to match the credentials for your database. 
'postgresql://<username>:<pass>@<server>:<port>/<db_name>'
(please don't push that to master)

Install redis server: windows - https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.0.504
	Check the checkbox to add the install path to the PATH variable during install.
	
Open the Terminal/Command Prompt in the root directory of the site and run the command "node app.js". This will get the server running. 
(Should be running at all times for the site to work. Needs to be reran if server files are edited)

Site should now be accessible and working at http://localhost:8080/
