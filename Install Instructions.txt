Install Python

Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
	Install necessary packages by running these commands in the Terminal/Command Prompt (I think that's all of them):
		npm i async
		npm i bcrypt@5.0.0
		npm i body-parser
		npm i connect-redis
		npm i express 
		npm i express-session 
		npm i formidable //not sure if necessary
		npm i jquery //not sure if necessary
		npm i mustache //not sure if necessary
		npm i md5
		npm i node-postgres@latest
		npm i node-schedule
		npm i nodemailer
		npm i paypal-rest-sdk
		npm i pg@latest
		npm i pg-promise
		npm i redis
		npm i redis-server
	
Install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
	Create a new database in postgre
	Run database_script.sql to set up the database (It's empty. You might want to add some placeholder products. I have a php script for that, but it needs an Apache server)
	
Open connector.js and edit the connection string to match the credentials for your database. 
'postgresql://<username>:<pass>@<server>:<port>/<db_name>'
(please don't push that to master)

Install redis server: windows - https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads
	Run redis-server.exe. It has to be running at all times for the site to work (I think)
	
Open the Terminal/Command Prompt in the root directory of the site and run the command "node app.js". This will get the server running. 
(Should be running at all times for the site to work. Needs to be reran if server files are edited)

Site should now be accessible and working at http://localhost:8080/
