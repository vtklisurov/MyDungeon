Install Python

Install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
	Install necessary packages by running these commands in the Terminal/Command Prompt (I think that's all of them):
		npm i async bcrypt@5.0.0 body-parser connect-redis express express-session md5 node-postgres@latest node-schedule nodemailer paypal-rest-sdk pg@latest pg-promise@latest redis redis-server  
		npm i formidable //not sure if necessary
		npm i jquery //not sure if necessary
		npm i mustache //not sure if necessary
		 
	
Install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
	Create a new database
	In PgAdmin4 click Tools->Restore and select the store_db file (hope this works)
	
Open connector.js and edit the connection string to match the credentials for your database. 
'postgresql://<username>:<pass>@<server>:<port>/<db_name>'
(please don't push that to master)

Install redis server: windows - https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.0.504
	Check the checkbox to add the install path to the PATH variable during install.
	
Open mail_credentials.js and input the details of the mail account the account verification email will be send from (please don't push to origin)
	
Open the Terminal/Command Prompt in the root directory of the site and run the command "node app.js". This will get the server running. 
(Should be running at all times for the site to work. Needs to be reran if server files are edited)

Site should now be accessible and working at http://localhost:8080/
